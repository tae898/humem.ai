			<strong>Self‑host (Free)</strong><br />
			Use our permissively licensed open‑source stack: SQL and NoSQL databases
			(relational, graph, vector, key‑value, wide‑column, document, search), analytics, and LLMs.
			Deploy on your infra with full control for agents and tools.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Managed Cloud (SaaS)</strong><br />
			We host and operate HumemAI for you: ingestion pipelines, hybrid
			relationship‑aware + vector retrieval, scalable SQL and NoSQL backends, monitoring, and
			updates. Optimized for <strong>agentic orchestration</strong>. Usage‑based pricing tailored to your workload.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tailored Ontology & Setup</strong><br />
			We design a domain‑specific ontology (schema), map your data from tables, documents, and graphs,
			tune connectors, and optimize retrieval across diverse databases. Ideal when you want a graph that
			matches your business semantics.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Support Plans</strong><br />
			Email support included for managed plans; optional SLAs and dedicated
			assistance available.
