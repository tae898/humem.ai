			<strong>Self‑host (Free)</strong><br />
			Use our permissively licensed open‑source stack (NoSQL DB, analytics engine,
			search engine, LLMs, vector DB). Deploy on your infra with full control.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Managed Cloud (SaaS/PaaS)</strong><br />
			We host and operate HumemAI for you: ingestion pipelines, hybrid
			graph+vector retrieval, scalable graph/database backends, monitoring, and
			updates. Usage‑based pricing tailored to your workload.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tailored Ontology & Setup</strong><br />
			We design a domain‑specific ontology (schema), map your data, tune
			connectors, and optimize retrieval. Ideal when you want a graph that matches
			your business semantics.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Support Plans</strong><br />
			Email support included for managed plans; optional SLAs and dedicated
			assistance available.
