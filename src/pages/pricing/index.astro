			<h1>Building Together</h1>
			<p>
				HumemAI is fully open‑source. We're focused on <strong>collaborative development</strong> with customers
to build tailored <strong>episodic</strong> and <strong>semantic memory</strong> systems that fit your specific
data architecture, schema, and business requirements.

<strong>Self‑host (Always Free)</strong><br />
Use our permissively licensed open‑source stack: episodic memory (temporal knowledge graphs for conversations) and semantic memory (SQL/NoSQL database integrations). Deploy on your infrastructure with full control over both conversation history and data access patterns.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Collaborative Development</strong><br />
Since we're in early stages and every customer's data architecture is unique, we don't offer plug‑and‑play SaaS yet. Instead, we work directly with you to understand your:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Data schema</strong>: Table structures, graph relationships, document formats</li>
			<li><strong>Database types</strong>: Which SQL/NoSQL systems you use and how they connect</li>
			<li><strong>Access patterns</strong>: How your applications read/write data</li>
			<li><strong>Memory requirements</strong>: What conversations to preserve vs. what data to query</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Together, we design and implement your episodic memory system (capturing conversation context) and semantic memory integrations (connecting to your databases). This collaborative approach ensures the solution fits your exact requirements while advancing our research.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Future SaaS Plans</strong><br />
			As patterns emerge from our collaborative projects, we plan to offer managed hosting for common architectures. For now, we're investing in understanding diverse data landscapes through partnership rather than premature standardization.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Investment in Research</strong><br />
Every collaborative project contributes to our open‑source research in episodic/semantic memory systems, temporal knowledge graphs, and hybrid retrieval across heterogeneous databases. Your implementation helps advance the field.
