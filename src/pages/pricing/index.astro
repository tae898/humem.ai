		<h2>What We're Building</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Episodic Memory</strong>: Natural language conversations automatically parsed and stored as persistent temporal knowledge graphs, capturing full context across interactions.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Semantic Memory</strong>: Multi‑model database integration that keeps your data in optimal formats — whether structured or unstructured — unified by intelligent adapters.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Hybrid Retrieval</strong>: Relationship‑aware queries across both memory systems, delivering answers that are contextually grounded and fully explainable.
		</p>

		<h2>Current Phase</h2>
		<p>
			We're contributing to open‑source databases and publishing research while building our integrated platform. Our competitive advantage comes from deep expertise in temporal graphs, multi‑model databases, and AI systems — not code secrecy.
		</p>

		<p>
			The SDK and example applications will be released as they mature. Follow our progress on <a href="https://github.com/humemai" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
