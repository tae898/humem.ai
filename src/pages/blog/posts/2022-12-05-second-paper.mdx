## Reinforcement Learning for AI Memory Systems

Our first HumemAI research paper, [A Machine with Human-Like Memory Systems](http://humem.ai/blog/posts/2022-04-04-first-paper/), did not use machine learning. Instead, all memory management policies were handcrafted. While these handcrafted functions worked well, they lacked adaptability to new environments. 

To address this limitation, we introduced **reinforcement learning (RL)** in this second paper. RL, one of the three pillars of machine learning—alongside supervised and unsupervised learning—operates on a fundamentally different objective: **reward maximization**. Unlike maximum likelihood estimation, RL allows agents to learn strategies that maximize long-term rewards, often leading to **superhuman behaviors**, such as those demonstrated by [AlphaGo](https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y?si=yIVkkPF4L3WHV6V0).

To evaluate our memory management system, we introduced a new toy environment: [RoomEnv-v1](https://github.com/humemai/room-env), which is more complex than its predecessor, RoomEnv-v0.

## Abstract

> Inspired by the cognitive science theory of explicit human memory systems, we modeled an agent with **short-term, episodic, and semantic memory systems**, each represented as a **knowledge graph**. To evaluate this system, we designed and released our own **reinforcement learning agent environment, "The Room"**, where an agent must learn how to encode, store, and retrieve memories to maximize its return by answering questions. 
>
> Our deep Q-learning-based agent successfully learns whether a short-term memory should be forgotten or transferred into the episodic or semantic memory systems. Our experiments indicate that an agent with **human-like memory structures** outperforms an agent without such memory mechanisms in this environment.
