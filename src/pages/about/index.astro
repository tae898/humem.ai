		<p>
			Unlike traditional AI models that start every interaction from scratch,
			HumemAI introduces a <strong>memory-driven approach</strong>. It
			automatically constructs a domain-specific ontology to narrow down the
			search space for data, converting unstructured information into a
			structured knowledge graph stored in a graph database.
		</p>

		<p>
			By integrating LLMs, users can interact naturally without dealing
			with complex query languages—they can simply ask questions, and HumemAI
			retrieves the most relevant insights from its evolving knowledge base.
		</p>

		<p>
			This system is designed for business intelligence, research automation,
			and AI assistants that need long-term learning capabilities. From
			analyzing large datasets to providing context-aware AI solutions, HumemAI
			is pushing the boundaries of what AI can remember and understand.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our long-term goal is to develop the most general ontology capable of
			covering any dataset. However, in many practical applications, such a
			broad ontology would be overkill. That’s why HumemAI dynamically
			generates specific ontologies tailored to each problem. This process is
			semi-automated with minimal human intervention, ensuring efficiency
			while maintaining accuracy.
		</p>

		<p>
			The HumemAI team has a strong academic research background, pioneering
			not only applied AI solutions but also contributing to fundamental
			research in AI, knowledge graphs, and cognitive computing. We are
			dedicated to advancing the field, bridging the gap between theoretical
			research and real-world AI applications.
