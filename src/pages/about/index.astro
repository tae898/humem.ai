			<h1>About HumemAI</h1>
			<p>
				HumemAI started from Taewoon Kim’s PhD thesis, <em>“A Machine With Human‑Like
				Memory”</em>. The core idea: glue together three pillars—<strong>machine
				learning</strong>, <strong>knowledge graphs</strong>, and <strong>databases</strong>—and
				add a human aspect by modeling an agent’s memory as a graph that persists, learns,
				and adapts.

		<p>
			From toy examples to real applications, the thesis explored memory as a
			knowledge graph, reinforcement learning for memory management policies, and
			persistence in databases so knowledge isn’t lost. That trajectory became
			HumemAI.
		</p>

		<p>
			Today, users interact through an LLM while HumemAI performs <strong>hybrid
			retrieval</strong>—vector similarity plus graph queries—to ground answers in a
			continuously evolving knowledge graph. It’s natural to use, explainable by
			design, and reusable across workflows.
		</p>

		<p>
			We’re open‑source first. The stack—NoSQL DB, analytics engine, search engine,
			LLMs, vector DB—is built with permissive licenses. Anyone can self‑host
			HumemAI for free. We also offer managed hosting (SaaS/PaaS) and tailored
			ontology design to fit your data.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our research focus keeps us ahead: integrating ML with graphs and databases
			to scale reasoning, improve retrieval, and automate schema/ontology learning.
			That’s how we move beyond short‑lived hype to durable capabilities.
