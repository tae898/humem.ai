		<h1>HumemAI: AI with Human-Like Memory</h1>
		<p>
			HumemAI is pioneering the future of artificial intelligence by integrating <strong
				>human-like memory</strong
			> into AI systems. Our goal is to create AI agents that can remember, learn,
			and evolve over time to enable more natural interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Given your data, HumemAI automatically builds a domain-specific
			ontology to narrow down the data search space. It processes
			unstructured data and transforms it into a structured graph
			representation, which is stored in a graph database.
		</p>
		<p>
			Powered by LLMs, HumemAI enables users to interact naturally without
			needing to learn database query languagesâ€”just ask questions, and the AI
			retrieves the most relevant information from its knowledge graph.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Stay tuned</strong> for updates as we push the boundaries of AI and
			knowledge representation.
