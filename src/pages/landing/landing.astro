		<h1>AI that actually remembers your data</h1>
		<p>
			Keeping conversation history is critical. HumemAI gives your AI persistent memory by storing chats in a <strong>temporal knowledge graph</strong>. We decompose messages into entities and relations and persist them in a property‑graph database, so you can see how dialogue evolves over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Use HumemAI as a chat with persistent memory—or bring your own data (relational tables, graphs, other NoSQL). Connect it once and talk to your data naturally; HumemAI handles <strong>hybrid RAG</strong> behind the scenes.
		</p>
		<p>
			HumemAI is fully open‑source and we contribute to databases and RAG. If you’re unsure which database fits or how to scope read/write access and queries, that’s our paid service: tell us your data and we’ll wire HumemAI to it safely.
