		<h1>AI that actually remembers your data</h1>
		<p>
			HumemAI combines LLMs with a <strong>graph‑structured memory layer</strong> backed by open‑source
			SQL and NoSQL databases (relational, graph, vector, key‑value, wide‑column, document, search),
			so every interaction becomes structured, persistent, and reusable for <strong>agentic</strong> workflows. Bring your tables, graphs,
			and documents—we store them wisely across the right engines.
		</p>
		<p>
			Under the hood, we do <strong>hybrid retrieval</strong>—vector similarity +
			relationship‑aware queries across your data—so you get the <em>best of both worlds</em> for <strong>agentic planning</strong> and reasoning without learning
			query languages. You just chat; we handle the structure and storage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Get explainable answers grounded in <strong>graph‑structured knowledge</strong>, continuously enriched
			from your unstructured data and prior conversations—ideal for <strong>agentic</strong> systems.
