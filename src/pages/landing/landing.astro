		<h1>AI that actually remembers your data</h1>
		<p>
			HumemAI combines LLMs with a <strong>graph memory</strong> backed by open‑source
			databases, so every interaction becomes structured, persistent, and reusable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Under the hood, we do <strong>hybrid retrieval</strong>—vector similarity +
			graph queries—so you get the <em>best of both worlds</em> without learning
			query languages. You just chat; we handle the graph.
		</p>
		<p>
			Get explainable answers grounded in a knowledge graph, continuously enriched
			from your unstructured data and prior conversations.
