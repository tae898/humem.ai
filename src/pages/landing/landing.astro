		<h1>AI with human‑like memory</h1>
		<p>
			HumemAI separates <strong>conversations</strong> from <strong>data</strong> using two complementary memory systems inspired by cognitive science:
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Episodic</strong>: Your conversations with HumemAI agents are stored as a <strong>temporal knowledge graph</strong> capturing the "where", "when", and "what" of each interaction. This personal, time‑aware memory can be visualized and persisted in graph databases for efficient read/write operations.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Semantic</strong>: Your databases—SQL (relational) and NoSQL (document, graph, key‑value, etc.)—connect through lightweight adapters. When needed, we apply minimal, reversible transformations so data aligns with supported engines and schemas—avoiding wholesale migrations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Together, these memory systems enable <strong>hybrid retrieval</strong>: relationship‑aware queries over your conversation history combined with semantic search across your data, delivering contextually grounded and explainable answers.
