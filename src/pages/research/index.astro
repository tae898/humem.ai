      <p>
        We work at the intersection of <strong>cognitive science</strong>, <strong>temporal knowledge graphs</strong>,
        <strong>databases</strong>, and <strong>AI (machine learning)</strong> to build agentic systems with
        persistent, explainable memory.

    <p>
      <strong>Conversation‑aware knowledge graphs</strong>: Modeling dialogue as temporal graphs that capture the "where", "when", and "what" of interactions—supporting time‑aware recall and explanation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Data integration across engines</strong>: Connecting to relational, document, graph, vector, and key‑value stores using thin adapters and minimal, reversible transformations to align with supported engines and schemas—avoiding wholesale migration.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Hybrid retrieval (relationship‑aware + vector)</strong>: Combining semantic embeddings with relationship‑aware queries over conversation graphs and data representations to improve accuracy, robustness, and transparency.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Temporal graph construction</strong>: Using LLMs and ML pipelines for entity/relation extraction, temporal schema induction, and continuous graph evolution from natural language.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Memory management policies</strong>: Learning what to store, summarize, link, and forget based on task performance and retrieval quality to support long‑lived agents.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Cross‑source query planning</strong>: Planning and executing operations that span conversation history and external data sources to ground answers in both interaction context and domain knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      We publish, build open‑source tooling, and validate on real workloads so results transfer directly into product capabilities. <a href="/contact">Collaborate with us</a>.
