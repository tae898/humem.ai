		<p>
			<strong>Hybrid retrieval (relationship‑aware + vector)</strong>: Combine semantic embeddings
			with relationship‑aware queries over graph‑structured representations for accuracy, robustness,
			and explainability—without forcing users to learn query languages. This enables robust <strong>agentic planning</strong> and tool use.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Ontology and graph construction</strong>: Use LLMs and ML pipelines to
			extract entities/relations, induce schema, and continuously evolve
			domain‑specific ontologies from raw data and interactions.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Memory management policies</strong>: Learn what to store, summarize,
			link, and forget using reinforcement learning and heuristics guided by task
			performance and retrieval quality—critical for long‑lived <strong>agents</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Query planning with LLMs</strong>: Plan and execute mixed SQL/NoSQL and
			relationship/graph operations, ground generation, and verify answers against the
			temporal knowledge graph layer—foundations for <strong>agentic</strong> reasoning and action.
		</p>

		<p>
			We publish, build open‑source tooling, and validate on real workloads so the
			results transfer directly into product capabilities. <a href="/contact">Collaborate with us</a>.
