		<p>
			<strong>Hybrid retrieval (graph + vector)</strong>: Combine semantic embeddings
			with graph queries for accuracy, robustness, and explainability—without
			forcing users to learn query languages.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Ontology and graph construction</strong>: Use LLMs and ML pipelines to
			extract entities/relations, induce schema, and continuously evolve
			domain‑specific ontologies from raw data and interactions.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Memory management policies</strong>: Learn what to store, summarize,
			link, and forget using reinforcement learning and heuristics guided by task
			performance and retrieval quality.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Query planning with LLMs</strong>: Plan and execute mixed SQL/NoSQL + graph
			operations, ground generation, and verify answers against the knowledge
			graph.
		</p>

		<p>
			We publish, build open‑source tooling, and validate on real workloads so the
			results transfer directly into product capabilities. <a href="/contact">Collaborate with us</a>.
